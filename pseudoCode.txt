class Dice
	Declare an integer vector to hold the dices' number. Call mContent.
	Declare a construstor to initial each dice's number.
	Declare a method called SetDices() to set number that in the mContent.
	Method : void SetDices( int index, int num )
		set the variable called num into the variable that in the index of mContent.
	
	Declare a method called ThrowDices() to give a random number to each dice.
	Method : void ThrowDices( int dices )
		for i ( 0 to size of mContent - 1 ) do
			give a random number that from 1 to 6 to each dice
		end for
	end Method
	
	Declare a method called PrintDices() to print every dice's value.
	
	Declare a method called Sort() to order the dices.
	Method : void Sort()
		for i ( size of mContent - 1 to 1 ) do
			declare a boolean value called swapped and set false
			for j ( 0 to i - 1 ) do
				if index(j) of mContent is bigger than index(j+1) of mContent then
					Swap their variable
					let swapped be true
				end if
			end for
			
			if the variable of swapped is false then
				break the loop
		end for
	end Method
	
	Declare a method called Swap() to Swap two value of mContent
	Method : void Swap( Vector<Integer> arr, int i, int j )
		let temp be the value in index(i) of arr
		set the value in index(i) of arr to be the value in index(j) of arr
		set the value in index(j) of arr to be temp
	end Method
	
	Declare a method called IsThreeOfAKind() to determine whether it is Three of a kind.
	Method : boolean IsThreeOfAKind()
		if the values in index(0~2) of mContent are same then
			return true
		else then
			return false
	end Method
	
	Declare a method called IsStraight() to determine whether it is Straight.
	Method : boolean IsStraight()
		if the values in index(0~2) of mContent are continuous then
			return true
		else then
			return false
	end Method
	
	Declare a method called HasPair() to determine whether it has a Pair.
	Method : boolean HasPair()
		if it is not three of a kind && two number in index(0~2) of mContent are same then
			return true
		else then 
			return false
	end Method
	
	Declare a method called Sum() to accumulate numbers of mContent and return the value.
	Method : int Sum()
		let sum be 0
		for i ( 0 to size of mContent - 1 ) do
			let sum be sum + index(i) of mContent
			let i be i + 1
		end for
